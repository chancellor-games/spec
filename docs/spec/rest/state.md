# State

You can get the full current game state with `/games/<game_id>/states` or the
game state after any action `α` with `/games/<game_id>/states/α`. Remember that
`0` can be used to get the initial state of a game. The `variant` query
parameter can be used to fetch a different variant than current. `variant=0`
will always be the same as not including the `variant` paramter.

``` json
{
  "game": {
    "id": "<game_id>",
    "name": "Ada's Fun Root Game",
    "state": "active",
    "seed": "<seed>",
    "created_by": "<player_ada_id>",
    "created_at": "2023-06-13T09:41:00+00:00",
    "actions": 1,
    "variants": 0,
  },
  "state": {...},
  "state_hash": "<sha_256_state_hash>",
}
```

The `state` field is fully game dependent and supports all valid JSON. The other
fields are all generated by the API.
